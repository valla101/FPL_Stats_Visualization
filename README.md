# FPL_Stats_Visualization
Repository with the objective of creating a visualization of statistics of real life as well as Fantasy Premier League related stats.

Fantasy Premier League is the official fantasy game for England's First Division Professional Soccer. It attracts over 7 million players worldwide! The purpose of this repository is to aid users in picking the best players for their squad!

This website will generate bar graphs as well as a table with updated Soccer statistics (such as goals scored, assists, etc.) as well as Fantasy Premier League related stats (Total FPL Points, FPL Player Value, Selected By (%), etc.). One of the most important aspects of Fantasy Premier League is deciding which players to pick; sometimes the decision between Player "A" and Player "B" can have a significant effect on a team's performance. In order to help users, a Player Comparison Feature has been included; a grouped bar chart highlighting important statistics can be generated with a click! 

Stay tuned for more developments on the website!
